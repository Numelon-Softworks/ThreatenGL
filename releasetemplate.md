# ðŸ“œ ThreatenGL x.y.z (Beta w)
- Fixed a small issue where a dependency version higher than the maximum supported version was being requested on some mod loaders. ( https://github.com/Numelon-Softworks/ThreatenGL/issues/4 )

- The mod is now properly working on Minecraft 1.17.1 and up.

Thanks to those who reported these issues on GitHub and Discord.

----------

## ðŸ“¥ Installing the Mod (Please read if you're using Quilt or Forge)
- If you are using Quilt, you will have to [install the Quilted Fabric API (QFAPI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl).
- If you are using Forge, you will have to [install the Architectury API for Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api).

Fabric and NeoForge work without any additional dependencies!
