# We're back on Modrinth! 🥳

After a challenging month (or maybe even more) of inactivity and a thorough moderation period, I'm thrilled to announce that **ThreatenGL** is back on Modrinth! I deeply appreciate the incredible support from the community on GitHub and Discord during this time. Your patience and encouragement have been incredibly valuable. 🤗

And again like last time, as we celebrate the return of ThreatenGL, I want to extend another heartfelt thank you to everyone. We've now achieved 5.5K downloads and 82 followers. Your support means the world and is quite motivating. The most important thing however is the community - again, it has grown and I've managed to foster an incredibly supportive vibrant, and kind community. ☺️

## 🤔 What's new?

- I'm excited to share that ThreatenGL has now moved from the `beta` stage to the `release` stage.
- **Modrinth**: ThreatenGL is finally back on Modrinth (Issue #14 ) 🥳
- **License Update**: Mod information pages should now correctly display the license as the `LGPL-3.0-only` SPDX identifier, so it should no longer show "unknown license" in mod information screens.
- **Minecraft 1.21 Compatibility**: After numerous requests, I've tested and verified that ThreatenGL works on Minecraft 1.21. This mod is now allowed to load on versions 1.21 and later, ensuring compatibility with the latest game updates.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **NeoForge Compatibility**: I've addressed a critical bug that affected NeoForge users, who encountered the "not a valid mod file" error. This issue was because of changes in (Neo)Forge's `mods.toml` file structure or naming conventions. With this fix, NeoForge users can finally enjoy a seamless experience again. ( Issue #13 )

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/Richy-Z/ThreatenGL/compare/1.3.2-beta.1...1.3.3-release.1>

Thanks to the amazing community who reported these issues promptly! 💖

----------
**Since 1.3.2-beta.1, ThreatenGL no longer requires any additional libraries to work! This reduces mod conflicts and incompatibilities.**
