# 🤬 ThreatenGL
Welcome to ThreatenGL!

ThreatenGL is a Minecraft mod that takes a stand against the outdated OpenGL version 3.2, ***threatening*** Minecraft to use the more modern version 4.6. This change can potentially boost performance and make the most of your hardware's capabilities.

## 🤨 What's the deal?
ThreatenGL is about enhancing your Minecraft experience. By ***threatening*** Minecraft to switch to OpenGL 4.6, this mod aims to unlock performance enhancements that might otherwise remain hidden. Users have reported smoother gameplay and better frame rates, especially on newer devices.

For a more detailed description of what this does, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Numelon-Softworks/ThreatenGL). (Mod developers, please read this to avoid conflicts!)

## ⚙️ How does it work?
ThreatenGL works its magic by tinkering with Minecraft's internals. By injecting some code into the game's graphics setup process, it convinces Minecraft to opt for OpenGL 4.6 instead of the old 3.2. This simple tweak has the *potential* to make a difference in how the game performs.

## ❗Notes
ThreatenGL has been thoroughly tested to ensure it doesn't explore your device. However, please keep in mind that this is still an experiment and the efficacy of this mod is being actively researched and discussed. While many users have seen positive results, **your** results may vary depending on your setup.
