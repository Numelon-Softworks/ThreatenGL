# Automatically build the project and run any configured tests for every push and submitted pull request.
# Provides a first line of defence against bad commits!

# Removed if statement inside capture build artifacts because matrix.java will always be 21.
# Cleaned up the yml file with better formatting and clear separation for better understanding.
